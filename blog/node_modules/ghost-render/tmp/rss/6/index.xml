    <li><span><strong>Realize that the rest of the world does not, in fact,      give a damn 
</strong>
It is easy to delude yourself that you are incredibly special. In fact, it is beneficial. But I hope that by working on an online presence you can show yourself that you really don&#39;t matter and won&#39;t be a superstar online. Delusions of grandeur, like that people care about what you did today, are damn common in the world of blogging. Understanding what one can and cannot do through online communication is worth exploring and busting those ego bubbles is a worthy task. Frankly, if you live and die by your online image, then something is really wrong with your self-esteem.
<strong> </strong></span></li>
    <li><span><strong>To learn about marketing and publicity without having to      face high stakes
</strong>
Whatever bloggers would like to believe, an online &quot;brand&quot; is still highly marginal. Most people do not read blogs. Think about that. Online communities are deceptive in that they make it easy to imagine that one is reaching a wide audience. Think about <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch </a>for example. Well known and influential? I bet that most people you know have never heard of it - even those in the relevant industry. TC, a wildly successful blog is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to people. It is easy to forget that online. (I think <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/articles/Boundaries.html">Eric Sink said it well</a>: &quot;Objects in browser are smaller than they appear&quot;)

Most employers won&#39;t bother finding out about your blog. Therefore I think this online thing should be about learning to market information - with little at stake. Failing doesn&#39;t really matter; you can experiment and not worry too much.
 </span></li>
    <li><span><strong>To write about things you care about for yourself
</strong>
I think the only reason to write is to preserve ideas you like, while perhaps helping some random people online. I think that is a good reason: I have been helped by random blog posts on many topics, and hopefully some of my posts will help someone.

&quot;Monetizing&quot; a blog is, I think, a rather bad reason to write. Not to discourage people (not that they would care), but putting up ads on a blog to me seems rather desperate unless you already have built up a huge audience. In terms of my quality of life, I don&#39;t see how making an extra 30 or 100 bucks a month are going to make any difference in my life. I have all the toys and ramen noodles I need and getting a few more does not matter. I like banner ads less than having to work an extra hour every now and then. (Obviously, if you are TC, this does not apply. But for $random_person like me, that is probably not going to be true.)</span></li>

I mean, if the information is out there, why not use it? I find it absolutely amazing that statistically so few people read books after they graduate.</p>
<p>I read:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Books - a bit over 50 books a year, essentially all of them non-fiction.</li>
    <li>Blogs, websites and news. I don&#39;t read general news websites, since I don&#39;t find them to be relevant. As for blogs and websites, I read them like books.</li>
    <li>Email.</li>
    <li>Scientific articles. More and more nowadays. I usually speedread them, since most articles aren&#39;t all that great :).</li>
</ul>
<strong>Reading books</strong></p>
<p>My yearly average comes to about a book a week, but usually I read less during the busy times of the year and more during vacations. I read books from the start to the end, unless the book is really bad. Really, I have only had two to three books in the last years which I could not finish (unbearably simple, totally boring or too &quot;sociological&quot;).</p>
<p>The best way to read quickly is NOT to read something. I.e. pick a good book and avoid reading crap. Generally I focus on the negative reviews (a single &quot;too simple&quot; review on a US textbook = don&#39;t buy) and the table of contents. I occasionally spend a lot of time on Amazon picking books for wishlists (one for each topic).  Then I do a second review before purchasing the books, picking the best from the wishlists I have.</p>
<p>When reading I try not skip ahead, since I find that speedreading isn&#39;t very pleasurable if you want to think and retain the information. If I come across a fascinating idea, I log it down in my notebook.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve kept a reading log since 2006. In the log 1) keep track of when I started reading and when I finished the book and the number of pages, 2) write a brief summary of the book and a rating. Keeping track of the books I read helps me see how much other things have taken time away from reading.</p>
<p>In the near-ish future I am planning to get the log up and on Amazon+here.</p>
<p><strong>Reading blogs and websites</strong></p>
<p>I don&#39;t follow blogs, I read them. When I find something interesting, I usually keep the website open in the browser until I have finished reading ALL of the articles on a site (well, everything in the archives that interests me). I am wondering if by doing this I am missing out on something, but so far not following blogs has worked fine.</p>
<p><strong>Reading emails</strong></p>
<p>Until a few years back I used to read all the mail I received. Now I don&#39;t. I keep three email boxes, roughly: personal mail, work mail and stuff I might want to know about (lists, random stuff). For anything I need to reply to, I will set the star icon in Gmail so I remember to get back to it. No icon = will never open again.</p>

The reason is not that I would want to share how my stamp collecting project is going or what I think about Obama. Frankly, I don&#39;t give a damn about status updates and I don&#39;t expect anyone to give damn either.</p>
<p><strong>What I would like to do is connect and get feedback from people who share my rather specific interests: tech entrepreneurship, product development and getting stuff done. </strong>Finland is a small country and sometimes it is hard to get into a good discussion on these topics. If this blog succeeds in sparking at least a couple of new interesting acquaintances and good conversations - it has worked.</p>
<p>(* I&#39;ve had this domain since 2002, first it was a discussion forum, then a wiki, then dead, and now hopefully a blog.)</p>
