Setting up a DNS server and getting domain names for your local computers is surprisingly easy - even on Windows.</p>
<p><strong>0. Preliminary setup: make sure each computer gets a constant IP address</strong></p>
<p><em>Before setting up the DNS server, you need to ensure that each computer or virtual machine gets a fixed IP address. Otherwise the IP address of the computer may change on each reboot.</em></p>
<p>This should be done on your router, which is usually located either at 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 (check your current local IP address by running the Command Prompt and &quot;ipconfig&quot;, which shows your current IP address). Check your router manual on instructions how to log in, most routers have a HTTP-based configuration system which can be accessed when connected to the router.</p>
<p>In my case (I have a Asus RT-N11), the address was 192.168.1.1. Make sure that the computers you want to setup IPs for are connected, then find the &quot;Status&quot; or &quot;DHCP Leases&quot; listing on the router web interface. This listing will contain the MAC addresses for each host. Here is mine:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-header">Host Name       MAC Address       IP Address      Lease
--------------------------------------------------------------</span>
HOST1        00-11-22-33-F0-AC 192.168.1.5     60016 secs.
HOST2        00-11-33-44-F2-2C 192.168.1.6     85074 secs.</code></pre><p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">MAC address </a>is a unique identifier given to each network adapter. It allows you to setup fixed IPs.</p>
<p>Find the router functionality which allows you to &quot;Assign IP Addresses Manually&quot;. This should enable you to specify a MAC address and a corresponding fixed IP address. Do this for each of the network adapters you wish to have a fixed IP address. On the Asus RT-N11 this was under &quot;IP Config&quot; -&gt; &quot;DHCP Server&quot;.</p>
<p>Add a MAC address &lt;-&gt; IP address pair for each computer.</p>
<p><strong>1. Get MaraDNS </strong></p>
<p>MaraDNS is a free, lightweight and relatively easy-to-configure DNS server for Windows and Linux. <a href="http://www.maradns.org/download.html">Download it from here </a>and unzip it to some folder.</p>
<p><strong>2. Configure MaraDNS</strong></p>
<p>Open &quot;secret.txt&quot; and change the value to something else (random characters).</p>
<p>The MaraDNS configuration is in the &quot;mararc&quot; file in the same directory. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server">DNS servers </a>have two sets of functionality. They can function as a &quot;Authoritative name server&quot; or a &quot;Recursive/caching name server&quot;.</p>
<p>Authoritative name servers specify IP addresses for domain names. Recursive name servers store information from authoritative name servers and pass on queries in a recursive manner.</p>
<p>We will be configuring both authoritative and recursive functionality in MaraDNS.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Authoritative configuration</strong></p>
<p>We will configure the server to provide authoritative names of the LAN domain names. Pick any domain, I chose &quot;local.com&quot; (note though that you will not be able to access the actual &quot;local.com&quot; website if you pick an existing domain name).</p>
<p>Add configuration lines to &quot;mararc&quot; like these:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>csv2 = <span class="hljs-list">{}</span>
csv2[<span class="hljs-string">&quot;local.com.&quot;</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;db.lan.txt&quot;</span></code></pre><p>Where <em>local.com </em>is the domain name you picked, and <em>db.lan.txt</em> is the name of the second configuration file which we will be creating next (change it if you want to name the second configuration file).</p>
<p>Create a new file named &quot;db.lan.txt&quot; in the same directory as MaraDNS.</p>
<p>For each of the computers you want to resolve to a name, add a line to &quot;db.lan.txt&quot;. For example, for two machines, one &quot;dev.local.com&quot; and the other &quot;blog.local.com&quot;, add the following lines:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>dev.<span class="hljs-preprocessor">%</span>       <span class="hljs-number">192.168.</span><span class="hljs-number">1.4</span> ~
blog.<span class="hljs-preprocessor">%</span>        <span class="hljs-number">192.168.</span><span class="hljs-number">1.6</span> ~</code></pre><p>Done!</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Recursive configuration</strong></p>
<p>We will setup MaraDNS to ask your default name servers for all other domains so that you can resolve all other domain names to their correct IP addresses.</p>
<p>Find out your ISP&#39;s DNS server addresses. These are likely to be listed either on the Router status page, or by checking the details on your network adapter.</p>
<p>Now add your ISP&#39;s DNS servers as upstream servers in &quot;mararc&quot;:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>upstream_servers = <span class="hljs-list">{}</span>
upstream_servers[<span class="hljs-string">&quot;.&quot;</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy&quot;</span></code></pre><p>Where <em>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</em> and <em>yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy </em>are your ISP&#39;s DNS servers.</p>
<p>Done!</p>
<p><strong>3. Run MaraDNS and test it using askmara.exe</strong></p>
<p>Double-click &quot;runmara.bat&quot; , and leave the server running.</p>
<p>Open a command prompt, navigate to the MaraDNS directory and try running:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>askmara.<span class="hljs-keyword">exe</span> Agoogle.<span class="hljs-keyword">com</span>.</code></pre><p>and</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>askmara.<span class="hljs-keyword">exe</span> Ablog.local.<span class="hljs-keyword">com</span>.</code></pre><p>You should get replies like this:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment"># Querying the server with the IP 127.0.0.1</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># Question: Agoogle.com.</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># NS replies:</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># AR replies:</span></code></pre><p>and:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-preprocessor"># Querying the server with the IP 127.0.0.1</span>
<span class="hljs-preprocessor"># Question: Ablog.local.com.</span>

<span class="hljs-preprocessor"># NS replies:</span>
<span class="hljs-preprocessor">#local.com. +86400 ns synth-ip-7f000001.local.com.</span>
<span class="hljs-preprocessor"># AR replies:</span>
<span class="hljs-preprocessor">#synth-ip-7f000001.local.com. +86400 a 127.0.0.1</span></code></pre><p>If you get problems with the first query, you messed up the recursive DNS settings (are your ISP DNS server addresses correct?), and if you get an error with the second query, you messed up the authoritative settings.</p>
<p><strong>4. Change MaraDNS to reply to queries from your LAN</strong></p>
<p>Shutdown the MaraDNS window, and change the first two lines of &quot;mararc&quot; to something like:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-title">ipv4_bind_addresses</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;192.168.1.2
recursive_acl = &quot;</span><span class="hljs-number">192.168.1.0</span>/<span class="hljs-number">24</span><span class="hljs-string">&quot;</span></code></pre><p>Where 192.168.1.2 is the IP address of the computer on which the server will be running and the &quot;192.168.1&quot; part of recursive_acl is the same as on your network (might be 192.168.0.0/24).</p>
<p>Start MaraDNS again, and leave it running.</p>
<p><strong>5. Setup your router to hand out your new DNS server</strong></p>
<p>Open your router&#39;s web interface and find the DHCP server settings. There should be an option to set up a DNS server. Write the IP address of the computer on which the DNS server will be running.</p>
<p>For each of your computers, disconnect the network (e.g. by disabling and enabling it in Windows, or by using &quot;ifconfig eth0 down&quot;/&quot;ifconfig eth0 up&quot; on Linux).</p>
<p>That&#39;s it, you should now be able to refer to your LAN computers by their domain names.</p>

<p>Kudos, Mixu.  Thanks to this well-written cookbook, I was able to implement a lan dns server on an ancient Win98 laptop.  The only change I had to make was removing the start and exit commands from the batch script that starts the server.</p>
<p>This works great.  I appreciate your taking time to provide the entry.</p>

I am also trying use the internal DNS server I have set up as an internet name server i.e. I have used DYNDNS to create a static hostname for my router, then I have updated the nameserver on my domain provider to the static hostname, now I need to forward nameserver requests from my router to my internal DNS server, can this be done with a router firwall forwarding rule?  Many thanks</p>

<p>Virtualization is awesome in software development and testing. It uses more resources (than having separate physical machines), but significantly reduces the hassles of setting up and running different operating systems on a single machine. Being able to start a new system without rebooting, having virtual servers and being able to store snapshots of different systems has been really useful.</p>
<p><strong>What is virtualization?</strong></p>
<p>Three-sentence definition from Wikipedia: &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_virtualization">Virtualization </a>is performed on a given hardware platform by host software (a control program), which creates a simulated computer environment, a virtual machine, for its guest software. The guest software is not limited to user applications; many hosts allow the execution of complete operating systems. The guest software executes as if it were running directly on the physical hardware&quot;.</p>
<p>Which basically means you can run multiple virtual computers on a single physical machine, each with their own separate operating system and access to the network.</p>
<p><strong>How I use virtualization</strong></p>
<p>I use virtualization for the following:</p>
<p><strong>1. Development servers</strong>: Running Linux in a virtual machine to provide pre-configured web servers for testing and doing development work. The main alternative would be to run a web server on the local computer (e.g. using <a href="http://www.uniformserver.com/">Uniform Server</a>). However, the key advantage in using virtualization is that the server installation is practically identical to the deployment installation - this is important since many dependencies of web applications such as PDF and Excel generation may work slightly differently on different operating systems. By using virtualization, these differences are eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>2. Testing IE6.</strong> Internet Explorer 6 is unfortunately still used in many corporate environments and still has a significant market share. It is an insecure and deeply broken browser, but unfortunately it still needs to be tested. Instead of keeping it installed on a separate Windows XP system, I keep a virtual machine around with IE6 and use it for testing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>3. Trying out beta software and server software.</strong> In particular, alternative Linux setups for servers which are often easier to do using fresh virtual machines rather than on a single server. If there are any problems, I can just revert the whole system to the previous snapshot.</p>
<p>One interesting website related to this is <a href="http://bitnami.org/stacks">Bitnami</a>, which offers ready-made virtual machines for various open source software tools. Worth trying if you want a particular web application working with minimal hassle.</p>
<p><strong>4. Low-hassle deployment of temporary/personal stuff.</strong> Also known as &quot;poor-man&#39;s-Xen-virtualization&quot;. I am planning on doing a small BIND DNS client setup soon to provide hostnames for the home LAN. I will probably build and test out the configuration on the my main computer, then just copy it to an older computer.</p>
<p>While there is a performance loss from deploying on consumer grade hardware with a consumer-oriented virtualization solution, it also allows you to use <em>almost any hardware</em> to host virtual machines (<strong>more lightweight hypervisors like Xen have rather specific hardware requirements</strong>).</p>
<p>And I am thinking about:</p>
<p><strong>5. Work desktop virtualization (looking into this).</strong> I move a lot between computers and hate having to spend time installing and customizing the different applications I use. In the near future, I am planning to move my work setup from a physical machine to a virtual machine, meaning that when I change from one physical machine to another, the only thing I need to do is copy the virtual machine and have all my programs and settings remain intact. There are two things holding me back: one, I would prefer to have my files stored outside VMs (I am a bit worried about losing them if the virtual machine gets corrupted somehow) and two, graphics cards are not supported on current virtualization solutions which is bad for graphics performance.</p>

<p><ol>
    <li> To ignore a directory, use -i path/relative/to/the/src/root/ with a &quot;/&quot; at the end (or &quot;&quot; for Windows). You <strong>MUST have that trailing slash,</strong> otherwise the directive is treated differently (filename match)</li>
    <li>To ignore multiple directories, <strong>you cannot use multiple -i -directives</strong>. If you do, they will overwrite one another, and only the last one will be applied. Instead, <strong>use a comma </strong>to separate the paths: -i first/path/,second/path/</li>
    <li>If you happen to use 1.4.3 and use the &quot;HTML:frames:earthli&quot; template, you will notice that the images and css files won&#39;t load because they are missing one character at the end for some reason. Solution: rename or copy the template from a previous version to &quot;./PhpDocumentor/Converters/HTML/frames/earthli&quot;.</li>
</ol>
Really, this is simple but the documentation is rather unclear as to how this works (particularly the point about the significance of the last slash character). I found some comments in the bug tracker which helped me find the correct syntax (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1780827&amp;group_id=11194&amp;atid=111194">here</a>). Both of these things are implied in documentation, but I figure writing this might save someone else some time.</p>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<p><strong><a href="#46" title="2009-10-19 02:14:42">Jim Lekas</a>:</strong> Thanks for the note.  Regarding point #3, not only images and .css files have truncated names, but also .tpl files and .js files.  Many, but not all, of the template files throughout the Converters tree (not only in PhpDocumentor/Converters/HTML/frames/earthli) are incorrectly named <em>.tp instead of </em>.tpl.  Changing the names corrects many problems with the converters.</p>
<p>If you have a file comparison program like WinMerge (<a href="http://winmerge.org/">http://winmerge.org/</a>), you can compare the .../Converters subtrees from PhpDocumentor 1.4.2 and 1.4.3 to find the misnamed files.  The Windows shell program &quot;RENAME&quot; will rename files by pattern (e.g. rename <em>.tp </em>.tpl).</p>
<p><strong><a href="#47" title="2009-10-19 02:24:14">Jim Lekas</a>:</strong> In my earlier note I mentioned using &quot;RENAME&quot; to change the file names.  A faster way is to use WinMerge to show only the files unique to the 1.4.2 version, select the files to copy, and choose &quot;copy right&quot; or &quot;copy left&quot; as appropriate to install them in 1.4.3.  Then show only the files unique to 1.4.3, which should be mostly the broken files, and select and delete them.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#49" title="2010-08-29 22:07:25">Jumper</a>:</strong> I gave up on using the phpDocumentor default templates.
They&#39;re not easy to navigate etc.</p>
<p>Found a good alternative here:

<p><strong>Do what is usually done - avoid unusual setups</strong></p>
<p>Open source software, whether it is an MVC framework (like Ruby on Rails, CakePHP or Codeigniter), backend software (such as Apache or a particular library) or end-user software (like Gimp or OpenOffice) is generally built scratch an itch felt by the author. There is nothing bad about this. However, expect to run into problems if your intended use is different from whatever the software is usually used for - despite whatever &quot;counterpoints&quot; offered by enthusiasts of that particular software.</p>
<p>As long as you use OSS for things that are commonly done, you will generally save time and money using it. However, if you step outside the common use, you will probably run into issues that are a pain to solve. As someone said, Linux is free if your time is free. I love having Linux on my netbook as a cheap and lightweight server,  but I have quit searching for solutions to anything that doesn&#39;t work out of the box (such as in my case, the WLAN drivers). It just isn&#39;t worth the time when one can dual-boot Windows with little effort.</p>
<p>Now if anyone were to actually read what I write in this backwater blog, they would blame me for being a lazy moron, or tell me that this issue in particular is due to the hardware vendor not providing adequate support (or only providing proprietary binary drivers). Well, I don&#39;t care whose fault it is. If you want me to use it (you probably don&#39;t), then get the damn problem solved. Knowing that I could muck around for 2-3 days trying different solutions doesn&#39;t really solve the problem. I appreciate the work (I really do!), but I will only use it if it works for me. (There is no law saying that just because you can do something with OSS, you must do it using OSS.)</p>
<p><strong>Passionate liars</strong></p>
<p>This applies to MVC and other development frameworks (and libraries) as well. They are built to match whatever their authors have been doing the most. A lot of web development involves simple CMS-or-blog-or-event-site type websites where having conventions and backend support such as ORM (object-relational mapping) is really useful.</p>
<p>The problem is that when evaluating different MVC frameworks, you will generally find someone who will insist that it can solve whatever key problems you need to solve in your project. They are lying.</p>
<p>As John McCarthy (Stanford) said: <em>&quot;Personal dishonesty is not needed to produce a dishonest business plan or research proposal. Wishful thinking suffices.&quot;</em></p>
<p>GIMP really is not the same as Photoshop and OpenOffice isn&#39;t Microsoft Office, despite arguments to the contrary. Enthusiasts aren&#39;t really lying, but they are blinded by their enthusiasm for whatever technology they are using to the extent that they cannot imagine why someone might have completely different needs. It works for them, which says nothing about whether it will work for you in your particular situation.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The smart and conservative approach to evaluating the alternatives is to give a lot more weight to perceived concerns (such as technology performance, platform support and maturity) than to whatever optimistic assurances the enthusiasts of any community offer you. If you see a number of side-mentions of concerns such as &quot;X does not scale very well&quot;, or &quot;X is hard to deploy&quot;, or &quot;X is very unstable&quot;, or &quot;X is not commonly used for Y&quot;, take note. More likely than not, it is true to some (significant enough) extent.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Someone (can&#39;t find quote) <em>said that you can judge an organization by the problems people concern themselves with</em>. Non-problems are generally not discussed nor are they debunked by passionate enthusiasts. Think about Java performance, or the usability of Linux-based OS installation. They were talked about a few years back, now they are essentially non-problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">
</span></p>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<p><strong><a href="#43" title="2010-10-19 20:53:39">Diwant Vaidya</a>:</strong> What differences did you see between Gimp and PS?  I am a little more comfortable in Gimp, although the multi window thing throws people (even me) initially.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#44" title="2010-11-01 02:05:38">Daniel Williams</a>:</strong> Nice backwater blog, you know I&#39;m the same way but I would add that it&#39;s not just OSS but any software / hardware package. I have window$ linux and now a OS X laptop. The OS X box just works, close the lid move to a different wireless network, open the lid and I back working.... This isn&#39;t an appl$ plug, I&#39;m still use my Linux and window$ machines for things that the OS X can&#39;t do...</p>
<p>Way fight it, life is to short to play for hours trying to get a square box in a round hole.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#45" title="2010-12-02 01:16:07">slm17</a>:</strong> i totally agree!</p>

Market size, first mover advantage and the idea of a hot or trendy business model are often mentioned as key factors, but I would argue that their impact is not quite as straightforward as some would argue.</p>
<p><strong>1. Market size != potential for success</strong></p>
<p>It is better to go for a credible-sized opportunity instead of a lemonade stand. However, counting on the idea that the company &quot;only&quot; needs to capture a small percentage of a large market is often a cop-out from coming up with an actual plan which relies on some kind of genuine advantage. In the long run, it is probably better to be a big fish in a small market rather than a small fish in a big market, given that as one of the &quot;best known brands&quot; in a market one can often achieve a sustainable position among pragmatist customers.</p>
<p>Saying that you have a 500 billion market and only need to capture 0.01 percent doesn&#39;t mean you are in a better position than someone aiming at capturing a larger percentage of a smaller market. It is often true that the bigger the market, the easier it is to find customers - but larger markets also frequently mean more competition, lower dollar amounts per sale, a more heterogeneous set of customers, larger advantages for being established in that market and larger capital requirements.</p>
<p><h3>2. First-mover advantage != potential for success</h3>
I read about this so often it makes me sad. Having first-mover advantage isn&#39;t really as great as it might intuitively seem. I am pretty sure that the obsession with being &quot;first&quot; to do something is more hurtful that useful. When people talk about &quot;first mover advantage&quot;, what they actually mean &quot;first-successful-mover advantage&quot;: being first to come up with an idea that was possible to scale profitably.</p>
<p>To me, that is not really about being there first, it is about being there at just the right time to get the product out to match the overall trend (in technology development, in market terms) to succeed.</p>
<p>Pioneers are the ones with arrows on their backs. They may have to develop a technology and a market for a long while just to find that a &quot;fast-follower&quot; gets there at the right time to capitalize on their work. Fast follower and first-to-market are both valid models for building a business, and not being there first may have it&#39;s advantages. <a href="http://paultyma.blogspot.com/2008/08/probably-hardest-sales-job-ever.html">Paul Tyma has an awesome anecdote</a> on this:</p>
<p><em>&quot;One of my favorites was [..] the idea of selling a new product that creates a brand-new niche - often a very difficult task.</em></p>
<p><em>He likened it to the first person that had to break ground selling thermometers. Not the &quot;How&#39;s the weather&quot; thermometers, I mean the &quot;Do you have a fever thermometers&quot;. Surely nowadays these are digital little gizmos, but when they came out they were the old-fashioned mercury based ones.</em></p>
<p><em>I can imagine the sales-pitch:</em></p>
<p><em>Customer: So, whats it good for?
Salesman: It will tell you your temperature</em><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Customer: Why do I care about that?
Salesman: Well, then you will know when you have a fever.</em></p>
<p><em>Customer: Um. I already know when I have a fever.
Salesman: Yeah, but now you&#39;ll be sure.</em></p>
<p><em>Customer: Erm.. k.. What&#39;s it made of?
Salesman: Glass</em></p>
<p><em>Customer: Whats that stuff inside it?
Salesman: Mercury - careful, its toxic.</em></p>
<p><em>Customer: How do I use it?
Salesman: You just put it in your butt for 2 minutes.</em></p>
<p><em>Customer: Um. So basically, you want me to take this toxic-substance filled thermo-thing made of breakable glass, stick it and leave it in my butt for 2 minutes so that I&#39;ll know something I pretty much already knew.
Salesman: Yepper.</em></p>
<p><em>Customer: Awesome - I&#39;ll take 2 !</em></p>
<p><em>That had to be a hard job. Solve a problem that was perceived as not needing solving and then do it in a new, dangerous, and highly uncomfortable way. &quot;</em></p>
<p><h3>3. Hotness/next big thing != potential for success</h3>
Being told that China is the next big thing, or biotech is the next big thing, or that energy and food is the next big thing is really only good if you are in those specialties. Chasing the next big thing just because someone thought it might be great is hardly a winning strategy.</p>
<p>Next big things have a wide margin of error in terms of timing and in terms of actually coming to fruition. Pursuing a trendy area of enterprise might find it easier to get funded, but that has little to do with actual success. Tools for Twitter might be the hot market now, but is it a good business to be in? For some, perhaps, but is it any better than some non-trendy market if you are thinking betting into it now? Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>Factors that might actually matter</strong></p>
<p>So what might actually matter? Here are a few good factors from experienced entrepreneurs/VC&#39;s:</p>
<p>James L. Woodward (<a href="http://www.mitforumcambridge.org/archive/r_jan04.html#editor">here</a>):</p>
<p><ul type="disc">
    <li><em>&quot;Do you have an      experienced team that knows the industry inside out?</em></li>
    <li><em>Do you have an      overwhelming and defensible advantage?</em></li>
    <li><em>Is your market the      right size?</em></li>
</ul>
<em>These remain the keys, with people, always people, first. And remember, that while the second point implies some sort of technology advantage, technology is not the primary driver of successful companies. &quot;</em></p>
<p>Philip Greenspun (<a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/business/startup-tips/">here</a>):</p>
<p><em>&quot;Don&#39;t start your own company because you want to be your own boss. There are three ways in which a company can make more profit than an investment in a Vanguard S&amp;P 500 index fund:</em></p>
<p><ol type="1">
    <li><em>You know how to do something that nobody else can do      (the typical MIT tech spinoff approach)</em></li>
    <li><em>You have a lower cost of capital than anyone else (the      &quot;my dad was really rich&quot; approach taken by Bill Gates and      others)</em></li>
    <li><em>You have a better understanding of one kind of customer      than anyone else.&quot;</em></li>
</ol>

There is an article that could be written on the information, but I can&#39;t be bothered. <a href="http://blog.mixu.net/files/2009/08/semantic-css-conventions.png">View the full-size version here</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#38" title="2009-09-09 18:56:13">ellisgl</a>:</strong> If you have navigation links at the top and bottom - why not do #header-navigation and #footer-navigation?
Also with the body id. I was thinking of different of controller-action-extra - ie index-page-2.</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>
<p><strong><a href="#39" title="2009-09-10 01:34:44">admin</a>:</strong> Strictly speaking I would prefer not having #header-navigation and #footer-navigation, because these names are based on the location of the navigation content, rather than purely semantic. The prefix is a bit redundant.</p>
<p>If you have navigation links at the top and bottom of a page, why not make a .navigation -class, and have that inside the #header and #footer. That way you can have for example: #header .navigation a and #footer .navigation a. (Or perhaps #content .paging for something like a paging control.). This way the class name/ID does not need to change completely (just the CSS), even if you decide to move the navigation out of the header, and you can have shared properties for the &quot;base&quot; class.</p>
<p>Body ID is probably the hardest one to answer properly. The choice of naming scheme really depends on whether the majority of your content needs to be tweaked on a page-by-page or a controller-by-controller basis. When CSS3 selectors become supported in IE (<a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200601/css_3_selectors_explained/">http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200601/css_3_selectors_explained/</a>), it will be possible to do a &quot;id begins with X&quot; -type match, at which point I think the long &quot;controller-action-extra&quot; form will be preferred. (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc351024(VS.85).aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc351024(VS.85).aspx</a> )</p>
<p>Right now, if you need IE6 support, you need to trade off between the two. With a IE7 minimum, you can use &quot;|=&quot; or &quot;^=&quot; and can use either plain &quot;controller&quot; or &quot;controller-action-..&quot;.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#40" title="2009-09-10 01:39:12">admin</a>:</strong> So for IE7 you might have rules like: body[id^=controller] { shared style specs } and body[id^=controller-action] { style for individual page } and body[id=controller-action-page-2] { style for page one of the action }.</p>
<p>I am still supporting IE6 in most of my work, however, so I have not tested this out that much.</p>

With screenshots!</p>
<p>All of these are free except Syncplicity and Pocket Informant.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Check out Opera Mini 5 as well - the beta is free, and is a ton better than Opera Mini 4 (which is included on Xperia). To install, visit <a href="http://m.opera.com/next">http://m.opera.com/next</a> on your mobile phone.</p>
<p><h2>Entertainment</h2>
<strong>Slide2Play (S2P)</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-359" title="s2p" src="http://blog.mixu.net/files/2009/08/s2p-180x300.png" alt="s2p" width="180" height="300" /></p>
<p>A simple but useful mp3 player: the best feature is, it activates automatically when you plug in the headphones and exits when the headphones are removed. Available for free from <a href="http://s2p.ac-s2.com/">A_C</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Xperia Facebook Panel</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-351" title="facebook" src="http://blog.mixu.net/files/2009/08/facebook-180x300.png" alt="facebook" width="180" height="300" /></p>

<p><h2>Productivity</h2>
<strong>Syncplicity mobile (m.syncplicity.com)</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-353" title="syncplicity" src="http://blog.mixu.net/files/2009/08/syncplicity-180x300.png" alt="syncplicity" width="180" height="300" /></p>
<p>Syncplicity is a online backup and syncronization tool for computers; it keeps files in sync across computers and is awesome. They have a mobile interface (<a href="http://m.syncplicity.com/">http://m.syncplicity.com/</a>) which allows me to access files that I have on my computer on the phone (with no extra effort). Available as a subscription service from <a href="http://www.syncplicity.com/">Syncplicity</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Sharing (installed by default)</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-355" title="netsharing" src="http://blog.mixu.net/files/2009/08/netsharing-180x300.png" alt="netsharing" width="180" height="300" /></p>
<p>Shares the internet connection via USB cable with a computer, allowing you to browse the web on your laptop using your phone as a GRPS/3G modem. Already installed.</p>
<p><strong>NuevaSync (Google Calendar syncronization over the air)</strong></p>
<p>Syncronizes my Google Calendar with the calendar on the phone, no docking needed! Their website may look really bad, but the free syncronization service is really good. No additional software installed, since they use Microsoft Exchange protocols to sync the data. Worth the extra effort of installing once; after that you get all changes on your calendar synchronized back to your phone. Available for free from <a href="http://www.nuevasync.com/">NuevaSync</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Gmail Mobile (<a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/h/">http://mail.google.com/mail/h/</a>)</strong></p>
<p>By adding &quot;h/&quot; to the address when making a bookmark, you get the mobile version of Gmail by default, which works great. (Works with Google Apps for Your Domain as well.)</p>

<p>After looking at the various blogging apps available for the phone, I found that it is much nicer to use a web interface. This is a mobile adminstration and reading interface for Wordpress blogs. Installed on the blog, not on the phone, but works quite nicely on the phone via the Opera browser. Available for free from <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack/">Wordpress.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#36" title="2009-10-02 07:57:16">Ville Virtanen</a>:</strong> Many of those features you mention are taken pretty much for granted by iPhone users... :) Should you switch to iPhone too... ? I mean, why download and customize your Xperia to resemble iPhone when you can have those features in cool desing? (U know me Mixu, just kidding... ;)</p>
<p><strong><a href="#37" title="2009-10-02 08:47:56">admin</a>:</strong> The iPhone is great, I recommend it for non-technical people and for entertainment use. It&#39;s a good package if you don&#39;t want to deal with installing stuff and customizing your phone. There are two main reasons I got the Xperia instead: 1) no physical keyboard on the iPhone (physical kb &gt; virtual kb &gt; number-only keypad) and 2) lower screen resolution on the iPhone (480x320 on iPhone vs 800x400 on Xperia).</p>

How do you get <a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/who-killed-the-virtual-case-file/0">170 million USD over budget</a>? One day at a time.</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.mixu.net/files/2009/07/epicfail-300x283.png" alt="epicfail" title="epicfail" width="300" height="283" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-264" /></p>
<p>Given the size of many of the largest failures (hundreds of staff members), there have had to be a number of people who recognized early on that the project was not going as it was supposed to. And still, someone made the decision to continue! In the FBI virtual case file project linked to above, the US Congress approved another $123.2 million for a project whose total cost would now be $581 million (instead of $458 million).</p>
<p>If the project is late and you are asking for, you know, a hundred and twenty million more, I would expect that someone would ask whether the whole project should be re-evaluated. But a re-evaluation didn&#39;t happen until well over a year later. There is something patently absurd about that. Reminds me of Bil Dwyer&#39;s fifteen wives clip on Comedy Central: <a href="http://comedians.comedycentral.com/bil-dwyer/videos/bill-dwyer---fifteen-wives">&quot;Imagine the nerve to look around at your fourteen wives and think to yourself ... one more.&quot; </a>. A hundred million $ more, and were done.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this happen?</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;d attribute the failure to re-evaluate the project to number of cognitive and organizational biases. Obviously, the cause of the failure itself may not be the biases, but rather the things that were done by those responsible for the project. But when you go over the budget and deadline and seem to be far away from achieving the original goals, why isn&#39;t the project cancelled or re-chartered?</p>
<p>In an article (<a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121533666/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0">available here</a> and also <a href="http://eight2late.wordpress.com/2009/05/08/the-role-of-cognitive-biases-in-project-failure/">discussed here</a>) Shore (2008) summarizes a number of cognitive biases as shown in the table below: <img src="http://blog.mixu.net/files/2009/07/bias.png" alt="bias" title="bias" width="518" height="706" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-266" />
(Shore, B (2008). Project Management Journal, Volume 39, Issue 4 p. 5-16)</p>
<p><strong>&quot;We can still do this&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The specific bias are not as important as the overall dynamic that causes failed projects to continue. Whether it is sunk cost, conservatism or illusion of control, the bias cause those responsible for the project to believe that they can still salvage the project, that all is needed is a bit more time, resources or people.</p>
<p><strong>Bringing about epic failure by avoiding the perception of failure</strong></p>
<p>There is a good reason for this. Most people consider revising the project goals to be an admission of failure which reflects badly on their careers and competency, hence preferring to stick to their guns. This may work in some smaller cases of failure and in cases where it is possible to trade quality for productivity, such as &quot;homework&quot; -type written assignments. But for projects where the quality is discernible, the number of people involved is large and increasing the number of people makes the project less likely to succeed - such as IT/IS projects - doing more of the same (which is the first reaction) is just not the answer.</p>
<p>As Steve McConnell said about project recovery:
<em>&quot;Remember, the real problem at this stage is not developing the product in the shortest time possible or creating the best possible product: <strong>it&#39;s completing the product at all</strong>. [...] If you&#39;re caught in the middle of a political skirmish rather than a product development, the project-recovery plan [...] won&#39;t be of much help, and you should choose your actions accordingly&quot;.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doing what can be done</strong></p>
<p>Here is a brief four-step program for doing what can be done to rescue a failing project. More details can be found elsewhere!</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Reassess the overall situation and pinpoint obvious problems. </strong>Any 12-step program begins by recognizing the problem. Without that, one ends up doing exactly what McConnell said: chasing the fastest completion or the best product, both of which are unlikely to be accomplished.
</li>
    <li><strong>Revise your goals.</strong> Since you have shown that you cannot do what you attempted to do, revise what you are aiming to do so that at least something can come out of the project. Set your goals to something more achievable.
</li>
    <li><strong>Restore morale.</strong> A important point in failed projects is that you are likely to be facing a morale problem already. While the &quot;official&quot; recognition of failure is sudden, many people are already overworked and demoralized. Do what you can to fix the people problem before continuing.
</li>
    <li><strong>Track the project meticulously to avoid sliding back into the abyss.</strong> If you don&#39;t get strict, you will continue to fail each day. As said earlier, spectacular failures result from day after day of slips. So stricter tracking of progress is the only way out of the abyss. Otherwise, the same slips that got the project here will continue.
</li>
</ol>

<p>There was an interesting quote on the &quot;<a href="http://diffle-history.blogspot.com/search?updated-max=2008-06-20T18:33:00-07:00&max-results=1&widgetType=BlogArchive&widgetId=BlogArchive1&action=toggle&dir=open&toggle=YEARLY-1167627600000&toggleopen=MONTHLY-1212296400000">Diary of a Failed Startup</a>&quot;:</p>
<p><em>&quot;How do you tell if you really are doomed?&quot; - &quot;If nobody cares about what you&#39;re doing and nobody on your founding team cares enough to change that, then you&#39;re probably in trouble.&quot;

I don&#39;t mean the kind of monetary things, where you will eat one candy today rather than a bag tomorrow - I mean in terms of time.</p>
<h3>What you don&#39;t do in the beginning will bite you in the ass later</h3>

<p>Take any project. The stuff you don&#39;t do well in the beginning because you were so anxious to move on or could not be bothered to do WILL turn out to be a big deal in the end if things don&#39;t go according to plan. And things never go according to plan.</p>
<p>The funniest thing is that when things go to hell, our natural reaction is to make more short-term tradeoffs looking for a quick fix (like add new methodologies, add more people, add more pressure).</p>
<p>Pay more attention in the beginning, before you are screwed. And if you are screwed, stop doing what you are doing, and give your project a real reboot.</p>
<h3>Seek victory from the situation you choose to be in</h3>

<p>Sun Tzu said: <em>&quot;A skilled commander seeks victory from the situation and does not demand it of his subordinates.&quot;</em> This seems to contradict my previous statement about planning, since plans as they are understood are pretty much about demanding something from other people.</p>
<p>Wrong. The way I interpret this, Sun Tzu is saying &quot;don&#39;t have a point in your plan which says you will perform at a superhuman level and thus succeed&quot;. Superhuman performance is at best a bonus for plan for which you have done that preceding legwork to ensure that other things: the environment, the customers, the competition and the governance structures are just right so that screwing up a bit will not kill you. Die because you did not execute, not because you did not care to look at the situation you are entering.</p>
<h3>What do you hate doing?</h3>

<p>My points is,  <em>there are many things which are both unpleasant to do and very effective when done early enough.</em> Here, early enough = voluntarily, not forced by the situation.</p>
<p>One of those things is thinking things through, writing them down and arranging ideas in order to explicitly clarify our own thinking.</p>
<p>We tend to like to think of ourselves as intelligent, thinking beings, but the extent of our thoughts is in fact often surprisingly shallow and random. We trust that we know while assuming many things.</p>
<p>For example, in research, it is easy to read promiscuously -- and to believe that that by itself will help increase our understanding. But I doubt that it is true - leaving the development and synthesis of ideas to some random blink of genius is a doubtful idea.</p>
<p>Managers tend to be victims of their own success. As Andy Grove (long-time Intel CEO and president) notes: <em>&quot;Looking back over my own career, I have never made a tough change, whether it involved resource shifts or personnel moves, that I hadn&#39;t wished I had made a year or so earlier. [...] This tendency is easy to see in others although we are prone to blindness when we do it ourselves.&quot;</em></p>
<h3>Make sure you fail for the right reasons</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t think I can put it better than how <a href="http://www.userscape.com/blog/index.php/site/comments/do_quit_your_day_job/">Ian Landsman put it</a>:</p>
<p><em> &quot;Here&#39;s the big secret on how to do this and fail for the right reasons. Your pre-planning needs to be 100% focused on making your success or failure about the execution. So you need to plan away those things that are not execution related. It&#39;s really not that hard to do. Make sure you can survive for enough time to see if it works out.&quot;</em></p>

Keep in mind that academic studies will rarely give you the simple answer - there is none. But what they can reveal is the chain of factors that, if done right, will lead to better results.</p>
<p><h3>Experts don&#39;t process faster, they process better</h3>
Classic studies such as de Groot (1965) and Chase &amp; Simon (1973) have shown that experts in chess do not consider more moves as much as they consider better moves and have a better knowledge (memory) of real chessboard configurations.</p>
<p>The effect of domain-specific knowledge is shown in the observation that chess experts do not perform any better at remembering random chessboard configuration but perform significantly better at remembering chessboard configurations from real games. However, the distinction between knowledge and processing ability is not as simple as it seems initially. Chess experts for example remember features relevant to the game better – they have learned to identify the most significant patterns in a chessboard configuration.</p>
<p>That is, their higher performance is a result of a superior processing strategy. Thus, to be an expert, you should improve your processing strategy - it is not about having more raw brainpower but rather having developed better mental models (schema) to process problems. As Detterman &amp; Spry (1988) point out:</p>
<p><em>&quot;It is highly unlikely that graduate student performance would correlate with IQ, because graduate students have been so intensively selected on the basis of intelligence that other factors become increasingly important. [This] does not mean that intelligence is not important. [C]ompared to that of the general population, graduate students would have a substantially higher IQ. [I]f graduate students were selected randomly from applicants [...] a relation between IQ and graduate school performance would be obtained. Samples that have a high degree of selection must be examined closely when discussing validity.&quot;</em></p>
<p>In other words, in a select group of people, non-IQ factors are emphasized more because simply being able to do a particular activity entails a level of selection. To be really good, you need to differentiate based on other factors. <small><small>(This comes up interestingly in executive training, where rather subtle soft skills are emphasized over other things. I suspect this is because the high degree of selection does not leave space for incompetence in less subtle areas.)</small></small></p>
<p><h3>The example of two teachers</h3>
How does such a superior processing strategy come about? Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter (1993) give the example of two teachers who begin their careers fresh out of college.</p>
<p>In their example they demonstrate the development of the teachers in terms of the skill development strategy the two teachers take. Initially, both teachers experience similar problems and have essentially the same list of difficult problems to solve. For example, maintaining order in the classroom, organizing their teaching material and keeping track of homework.</p>
<p>As they learn while working they address the problems on the top of the list (such as maintaining discipline) and can remove the problem from their lists by developing an effective routine for dealing with (e.g. shout at the top of their lungs - I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not a teacher) or preventing the issue.</p>
<p>However, the key difference between the two teachers – who both are doing good at this point in their careers – is that while one of the teachers is simply reducing the number of problems without revising the goals of her efforts, the other teacher is setting new goals as she is more able to cope with her initial problems.</p>
<p><h3>Problem reduction versus progressive problem solving</h3>
In other words, simply knowing more does not make you an expert. If your learning goal is to get rid of all the problems in your day-to-day work - rather than to both solve those problems and add new, tougher problems on the other end - you are becoming a specialist in dealing with those particular kinds of problems.</p>
<p>The problem-reduction approach taken by the first teacher in the example is a typical example of normal adaptation to an environment. Initially, the problem-reducing teacher is challenged by the environment, but as she learns more she is less and less challenged by daily events in her environment. She is able to get the kids to shut up and sit down, and life gets easier each day.</p>
<p>The problem-reducing approach distinguishes experienced people from less experienced people, but does not result in expertise as much as adaptation. At some point, the first teacher can essentially handle a set of routine problems without a lot of challenge. However, they will never start tackling the heavier issues, such as how to get a student with a learning difficulty to learn better. The teacher who took the progressive problem solving approach by setting new goals continues to advance towards expertise in her profession.</p>
<p><h3>Reinvesting in learning</h3>
As Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter (1993) point out, the experts skill development strategy is characterized by reinvestment of effort into the work instead of simply reducing the amount of effort taken by the work.  The authors argue that the general characteristics of expert skill development through progressive problem solving are:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Reinvestment in learning.</strong> As the learner needs to spend less effort in achieving the same performance, the reduction in effort is used in learning, thus resulting in continued improvement.</li>
    <li><strong>Seeking out more difficult problems.</strong> The learning effort is not simply characterized by a quantitative change in the amount of effort required to solve the problems – it represents a qualitative change in the type of problems and knowledge requited to solve them.</li>
    <li><strong>Tackling more complex representations of recurring problems.</strong> Initially, many problems are represented in a simplified form in order to cope with the demands of the environment and task at hand. However, as expert learners develop, the aim to reformulate the problem more specifically, allowing them to deal with the problem with greater flexibility. <small><small>(For example, rather than coercing compliance from difficult students, the teacher recognizes and begins to address the underlying learning problems.)</small></small></li>
</ol>
The skill development strategy leading to expertise differs from the one leading to non-expert performance in that it requires that the learner not only improves in performance but also that he or she continues to set new goals and new targets, and that the improvements in performance are used in order to address ongoing issues at a greater level of depth. This process is principally internally driven and motivational processes play a major part in enabling expert skill development.
<h3>Different kinds of learning goals</h3>
The different orientations of expert and nonexpert students can be expressed quite well in terms of goals. Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter (1993) suggest three different types of goals which different kinds of learners use to guide their actions:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Task accomplishment goals.</strong> Task goals are focused on performance on a particular task or activity; learning is incidental.</li>
    <li><strong>Instructional goals.</strong> Instructional goals are based on explicit or inferred learning objectives which are based on an external standard but go beyond task accomplishment.</li>
    <li><strong>Knowledge-building goals.</strong> Knowledge-building goals are set by the learner him/herself and may include other types of goals but are not limited to them. Knowledge-building goals are usually related to a personal aim to understand a problem or a field of knowledge.</li>
</ol>

Learning does not necessarily mean growth and treating all skills with same learning approach is unlikely to be successful.</p>
<p>Each one of us has a &quot;comfort zone&quot;, an area within which we are comfortable doing things. One can learn more about the same things (PhD&#39;s &quot;know everything about nothing&quot; because their learning is highly specialized) or more about new things.</p>
<p>The key is to realize that we tend to strongly prefer staying in our comfort zone: not just by consciously avoiding unfamiliar and uncomfortable situations but also though our choices. The choices in particular are insidious because they limit the things we can learn: for example, choosing an academic specialty, choosing whether or not to go that event or choosing how we spend our free time.</p>
<p>For instance, for someone who feels uncomfortable with public speaking, always letting someone else handle the speech for an event may be comfortable but it will get in the way of learning.</p>
<p>Here is my model for learning stuff (see detailed advice below):</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mixu.net/files/2009/06/learning_new_things_model.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1042" title="learning_new_things_model" src="http://blog.mixu.net/files/2009/06/learning_new_things_model.png" alt="" width="508" height="355" /></a></p>
<p><h3>Comfortable - Routine</h3>
Routine things are things you do every day and almost know well enough to do blindfolded. You are probably being paid to do them, and you probably are pretty sophisticated (or at least better than the layman). In learning more, you need to be very specific about what you do to learn anything new. More discipline is useful.</p>
<p>You should probably be looking at which of these things you REALLY should be doing and which of these you could teach someone else and get rid of, and which add so much value that you ought to keep doing them. Be very strict.</p>
<p><em>Key question is: Which routine parts are unavoidable? What should you drop?</em></p>
<p><strong>The danger is doing too much crap</strong>, but realize that eliminating all routine things is unrealistic and useless as well. The reason why you can do these things well is because they are routine, and that is why someone may be willing to pay for you to do them. Someone who does not do anything routine or easy is also known as an amateur, and who is willing to pay for that?</p>
<p><h3>Comfortable - Easy</h3>
These are the activities which are not routine, but you probably enjoy doing them a lot. They are your strengths or special skills and are related to the area which you have chosen to study or specialize in. You have not done enough for them to be routine, but they aren&#39;t hard either, just time-consuming.</p>
<p>You probably could be doing more of these activities, since you are learning more by doing them and are using your strengths. More focus is useful.</p>
<p>However, remember that not everything easy is worth doing. Becoming an ace in these requires focus. Otherwise you are doing too damn many things that are easy but not necessary.</p>
<p><em>Key question: What should you develop? What should you reduce?</em></p>
<p><strong>The real danger here is plateauing in your skill level.</strong> Even if you are good today, you will get worse as the world around you changes. In IT, this is particularly obvious as new technologies are constantly emerging - similarly with other industries: new business models, new regulations, new procedures.</p>
<p><h3>Uncomfortable - New</h3>
These are the activities which are related to what you find are your strengths, but you only have limited experience in doing them. Because of this, you find them a bit uncomfortable.</p>
<p>You definitely are not doing enough of learning by doing these things.</p>
<p>The hardest part in these things is actually getting started. You will most likely prefer to spend time on easy and routine things rather than doing these. You are likely to give yourself some excuse even if you are thinking about new things you ought to do. Being more willing to hit your head on the brick wall every now and then is useful.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do is remember that you should be doing these things <strong>before you are completely ready to do them</strong>. If you are avoiding failures, you are being too conservative. Failures and negative experiences tell you that you are doing it right: take on the risk. You learn though hardships, not slam-dunk successes. This is particularly hard for people who like to win: you know you might not win, so it feels unpleasant to start.</p>
<p>Force yourself to get started. Page by page, product by product.</p>
<p><em>Key question: What opportunities should you create?</em></p>
<p><strong>The danger here is not taking that jump. </strong></p>
<p><h3>Uncomfortable - Scary</h3>
There probably aren&#39;t that many you can think of immediately, because normal people tend to live in a zone of comfort through their prior choices.</p>
<p>You probably don&#39;t care about some of these things. Other &quot;scary&quot; things are things that keep coming up in your life as limitations. For example, not feeling comfortable about public speaking is scary for some people (while just new or easy for others).</p>
<p>You are limited by what you believe you cannot do, and you will keep facing situations where you are limited by your lack of learning every now and then. The limitations - the reason(s) you do not feel comfortable with these activities - are most likely a side-effect of your strengths. While sometimes not having enough time is a real and concrete resource limitation, sometimes it is an excuse. It could also be both: <strong>you don&#39;t have time to hone the skills because you do other things, and you are not likely to spend any available time on these since they are &quot;scary&quot;. </strong></p>
<p>Being more forgiving for yourself and taking bite-sized challenges is better than overdoing and deterring yourself from future action. Case in point: exercise and dieting - they are uncomfortable, you muster the motivation to start, you overdo them and then quit after a short while because they were unpleasant to do. Wrong approach. Start with small steps, make sure you actually enjoy the small changes and build on that.</p>
<p><strong>Realize that you cannot build a life based on elimination weaknesses but rather you should be building on your strengths.</strong> If the limitations are worth overcoming, then you may want to spend time, but realize that it is less likely that you will truly excel in these things. Don&#39;t limit yourself prematurely by believing you can&#39;t do these things, but don&#39;t be delusional either.</p>
<p><em>Key question: Why are these things scary to me? Do I want to be able to overcome the limitations? If yes, then what is a relatively non-threatening way to incorporate these into my life? </em></p>
<p><strong>The keywords are non-threating and incorporate.</strong> You are already scared, so don&#39;t kill yourself and don&#39;t set yourself up for a negative experience. Incorporating something into your life means making it a reasonably frequent part of your life. If it isn&#39;t reasonably frequent by design, you will not get the relevant experience and learn. Remember, these things are unpleasant, so a bit of pressure works well (e.g. deciding to accept opportunities to speak in public, then promising it to the event organizer to pressure yourself to prepare and perform).</p>
<p><strong>The danger</strong> is either ignoring these things completely with no good reason and suffering the consequences as reduced opportunities OR doing too much suddenly and getting permanently turned off from even trying because of the negative experience.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#30" title="2010-12-09 00:43:36">yash</a>:</strong> great article, I like that chart and believe if you draw arrows (counter-clockwise) starting from : bottom right -&gt; top right -&gt;top left -&gt;bottom left, it completes a graph that shows our learning process. So it&#39;s pretty interesting to know that how we utlimately have to overcome our fears and anxiety to become more comfotable in new circumstances.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#31" title="2011-06-15 12:38:26">Phrax</a>:</strong> Really nice article. I know, maybe it is a bit late to say so, but I discovered your blog not until last week. I had to get started with Kohana and so I read your articles about the auth module, tried your useradmin module (great work) and when I started reading your articel about the i18n module/functionality a few minutes ago I saw your &#39;Posts I like, but you don&#39;t&#39; category and this article attracted my attention.
I like your model - it reminds me of several situations where I did not make the jump... Maybe with your model in my mind next time I will rethink it, and - who knows - I will mak the jump ;)</p>
<p><strong><a href="#32" title="2011-08-04 18:24:13">Arhuman</a>:</strong> Great article !</p>
<p>Simple truths, worth remembering...</p>
<p><strong><a href="#33" title="2012-02-16 18:19:19">Bob Corrick</a>:</strong> &quot;Post I like, you like, but few others do&quot;. I&#39;m trying a semi-uncomfortable new thing.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#34" title="2012-04-14 15:25:38">Jae Task</a>:</strong> Great article!  Personally  i think i am addicted to learning but can definitely use the advice here to tackle other fears. I used to travel loads, sometimes 10 or more countries a year. I havent been out of the uk for four years now and i think that also is down to the scare factor. Its become more scary because i havent done it for so long. The thing to note is that even if you are on your game and studying lots, dont just stop or assume you&#39;ll always be on the case. You need to keep up the momentum.</p>

I started with a fresh VM install for this guide.</p>
<p><strong>1. Get the dependencies and tools</strong></p>
<p><code>yum install wget
yum install python mercurial trac trac-mercurial
yum install python-devel python-setuptools python-genshi python-docutils python-pygments mod_python
</code></p>
<p><strong>2. Get easy_install to work on FC10</strong></p>
<p><code>wget <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py">http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py</a></code></p>
<p>Here is the first (minor) pitfall. You need to force the update of easy_install. If you only run &quot;python ez_setup.py&quot;, then you will not get the easy_install command (bash will not recognize it). Run:</p>
<p><code>python ez_setup.py -U setuptools</code></p>
<p><strong>3. Install the mercurial plugin</strong></p>
<p><em>From: <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MultipleRepositorySupport">http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MultipleRepositorySupport</a></em></p>
<p>Check out the mercurial plugin:
<code>svn co <a href="http://svn.edgewall.com/repos/trac/sandbox/mercurial-plugin-0.12">http://svn.edgewall.com/repos/trac/sandbox/mercurial-plugin-0.12</a> </code></p>
<p>Build the mercurial plugin. From within the checked-out directory, build the egg file (it will end up in the dist subdirectory):</p>
<p><code>python setup.py bdist_egg</code></p>
<p>Check out the multirepos branch:</p>
<p><code>svn co <a href="http://svn.edgewall.com/repos/trac/sandbox/multirepos">http://svn.edgewall.com/repos/trac/sandbox/multirepos</a></code></p>
<p>Install the multirepos version of trac (from within the multirepos directory, as root):</p>
<p><code>python setup.py install</code></p>
<p><strong>4. Get the development branch of Genshi</strong></p>
<p>Here you will run into the error &quot;No local packages or download links found for Genshi&gt;=0.6dev-r960&quot;. To fix this, you need to force an update of Genshi to the latest dev version:</p>
<p><code>easy_install -U &quot;Genshi==dev&quot;</code></p>
<p><strong>5. Create your trac environment directory</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>trac-admin /path/to/trac/myproject initenv
chown -R apache:apache /path/to/trac/myproject</code></p>
<p><strong>6. Setup Apache for Trac</strong></p>
<p><code>nano etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</code></p>
<p>Add something like:</p>
<p><code>&lt;Location &quot;/trac&quot;&gt;
SetHandler mod_python
PythonInterpreter main_interpreter
PythonHandler trac.web.modpython_frontend
PythonOption TracEnvParentDir /path/to/trac
PythonOption TracUriRoot /trac
&lt;/Location&gt;
</code></p>
<p>And if you haven&#39;t added mod_python already:</p>
<p><code>LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.so</code></p>
<p><strong>7. Continue with the setup</strong></p>
<p><em>From: <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MultipleRepositorySupport">http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/MultipleRepositorySupport</a></em></p>
<p>Copy the mercurial plugin egg file to the &lt;trac-env&gt;/plugins directory. Make sure the following is somewhere in &lt;trac-env&gt;/conf/trac.ini, adding all the desired repositories to the [repositories] section:
<code>[components]
tracext.hg.* = enabled[repositories]
my_repo_a.dir = path_to_a_repository</p>
<p>[trac]
repository_dir = path_to_default_repository
repository_type = hg</p>
<p>Note that when the repository .type is not specified, the value of [trac] repository_type is used.</p>
<p></code></p>
<p><strong>8. Restart apache and test</strong></p>
<p><code>service httpd restart</code></p>
<p>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost/trac">http://localhost/trac</a> .</p>
<p><strong>Some possible errors</strong></p>
<p>If you get something like:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-title">Available</span> Projects</code></pre><pre class="hljs"><code>    * attachments: Error
      ([Errno <span class="hljs-number">2</span>] No such <span class="hljs-built_in">file</span> <span class="hljs-operator">or</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">directory</span>:
<span class="hljs-string">&#39;/path/to/trac/env/attachments/VERSION&#39;</span>)</code></pre><p>Check your <em>TracEnvParentDir</em> in httpd.conf, it is probably incorrect. (And restart apache.)</p>
<p>If you get the error:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-string">&quot;Unsupported version control system &quot;</span>hg<span class="hljs-string">&quot;: Can&#39;t find an appropriate component, maybe the corresponding plugin was not enabled? &quot;</span></code></pre><p>Check if you copied the TracMercurial-0.12.0.6dev_r7902-py2.5.egg file to the correct location. (And restart apache.)</p>

<p>Step 1:
  My CentOS 5.4 system was missing these packages (for step 5); one is
  from base and one from rpmforge:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>yum install sqlite-devel <span class="hljs-keyword">python</span>-sqlite2</code></pre><p>Step 3:
  The URL for Trac and Mercurial Plugin moved, use:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code> svn co <span class="hljs-symbol">http:</span>/<span class="hljs-regexp">/svn.edgewall.org/repos</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/trac/plugins</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/0.12/mercurial</span>-plugin

 svn co <span class="hljs-symbol">http:</span>/<span class="hljs-regexp">/svn.edgewall.com/repos</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/trac/trunk</span> trac-trunk</code></pre><p>Step 6:
  Before adding to &#39;http.conf&#39; check for a file at: /etc/httpd/conf.d/trac.conf</p>
<p>In the end, though, Genshi 0.6 doesn&#39;t seem to be available for CentOS -- so, I didn&#39;t get this working (yet).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t usually write &quot;raw&quot; JavaScript code, that is, JS code that does not use an existing framework - mainly because using code that has been tested in multiple browsers is better in most cases than writing your own code from scratch and testing it with different browsers.</p>
<p>However, every now and then it seems a project is small (and non-commercial) so that using a framework would be overkill. These are the times when the differences between Internet Explorer&#39;s JavaScript support and that of other browsers is painfully obvious. Here are two relatively recent examples and solutions:</p>
<h3>1. The IE innerHTML and &quot;Unknown runtime error&quot;</h3>
The JS engine in IE is notoriously unhelpful when encountering errors. One thing in particular has bit me in the ass so many times it is not funny anymore. This is the occurrence of a &quot;Unknown runtime error&quot; when attempting to assign a value to an element in IE via the innerHTML attribute. For example:
<pre lang="javascript">document.getElementById(&#39;containing_element_id&#39;).innerHTML
    = &#39;<a href="http://something">A link text</a>&#39;;</pre>
<strong>Looks innocent, doesn&#39;t it? However, in IE this code may or may not fail with an unknown runtime error depending on the context.</strong> For example, if another link is already applied to the containing element, then this code will fail on IE. Firefox, Opera and Safari will perform some code cleanup and allow this to work as expected (the content of the element is changed to that link). IE, on the other hand, fails with little warning. The point is, IE is very strict when it comes to nesting elements - in the specifications, nested links are not allowed.

<strong>This is not a bad thing in my opinion - standards ought to be followed. The problem is, IE will not give you any clues as to what went wrong. </strong>If the code is more complex than in the example, and it mostly is, then this will take a long time to correct.

There is one way to diagnose whether this problem is due to a previous tag which ought to closed per specifications: in IE8, you can use the debugging tools (F12) and set a breakpoint at the offending line of code. If the element itself can be retrieved via getElementById, then the problem is probably with a runaway tag somewhere earlier on the page. Once you find the offending tag (or the logic that generated it), you can fix the problem.
<h3>2. The IE extra comma error</h3>
A very painful bug that took me long time to hunt down was related to how IE handles object initialization. In any complex application, you are most likely generating JavaScript code or setting JavaScript variables from the server using some other programming language, for example by generating JSON data structures via PHP:
<pre lang="php">foreach ($a as $k =&gt; $v) {
   $result[] = json_encode($k).&#39;:&#39;.json_encode($v);
}
   $data = &#39;{&#39; . join(&#39;,&#39;, $result) . &#39;}&#39;;</pre>
At some point this data is combined and outputted to the browser as JavaScript code. Sometimes there will be cases in which an additional comma (&quot;,&quot;) is left on that JSON string because of some data not being included. In other browsers, this is not a problem: Firefox for instance can handle code like:

<strong>See that extra comma at the end? It will cause IE to fail silently and prevent the rest of the code from being executed!</strong> You can imagine how much fun it is to spend a few days debugging complex AJAX UI code to find that a single additional character was the problem.

And that can take more than a while, particularly if one does not know what to look for. And once you find the problem, you will not know whether to scream or to cry. My advice? Stick to tested code and be aware of these errors when you start debugging to avoid going on a wild goose chase.

<h3>IE is being mean to me again</h3>

<p>Somebody linked to this, I think it&#39;s awesome and probably appropriate if you arrived here via Google:</p>
<p><em>&quot;I tried Jquery, Moo tools and Prototype,
but IE still won&#39;t display my widget right</p>
<p>and have you experienced the horror
of debugging in Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to say that I simply do not care,
but how can I ignore so much market share?&quot;</em></p>

This way I can write reviews on Amazon and have them automatically added to my own site.</p>

<p>Amazon offers an RSS feed of your reviews under your profile, see the link in the &quot;Public Reviews Written by You&quot; heading on &quot;Your Profile&quot;. What we will do is use this RSS to create a new site. </p>

<p><b>Get Simplepie (and CodeIgniter, if you want to)</b></p>

<p>I am going to set up the site using the <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter </a>MVC framework and the <a href="http://simplepie.org/">SimplePie </a>RSS reader library. You don&#39;t really need to use CodeIgniter, but I wanted to give it a try. First download SimplePie and move the simplepie.inc file under /application/libraries and rename it to &quot;simplepie.php&quot;. Set up CodeIgniter as instructed in the user guide.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2 (Oct 2009):</strong> Since this is reasonably popular content, here are some additional findings:</p>
<p>First, Flash does not always use the same settings as your browser - try the proxy settings in Internet Explorer/Chrome. These seem to work better. The vast majority of problems are a result of Flash using different settings than your browser, revealing your actual IP to Hulu.</p>
<p>Second, if this does not work you can always use <a href="http://www.proxifier.com/">Proxifier </a>(commercial product with 30 days trial), a TCP wrapper which forces all connections on the computer to use a particular proxy. This can be used in conjunction with a Hulu downloader, such as <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5310467/hulu-video-downloader-saves-your-favorite-shows-for-offline-enjoyment">Hulu Video Downloader</a> to download the videos.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong><em> Still works </em><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/06/control-freaks-hulu-now-blocks-anonymous-proxies-too/"><em>even after Hulu tightened their geofiltering</em></a><em>. As long as one isn&#39;t using a mainstream service like Hotspot Shield, I doubt Hulu will be able to fully block this since they are in essence removing access from legitimate US computers. Probably the best thing would be to have a server set up in a legitimate, large institution such a US university or have a home-based server on a consumer ISP in the US. Both would make it hard to block the IP without causing legitimate users to be blocked as well. Then again, for me this is more of an interesting thing to do rather than a necessity. Mileage may vary depending on how proactive Hulu gets, in the end all anyone needs is one non-blocked legitimate IP address in the US.</em></p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu">Hulu</a>, it&#39;s basically a website like YouTube but with full episodes of recent TV series - legal and with short commercials inserted into the video streams. For instance, the HBO show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.S.I.">CSI </a>is available on the site very soon after it has been shown in the US and you can watch it directly as streaming video. There is one caveat - the website blocks non-US viewers from watching any of the videos. So, no luck for us Finns.</p>
<p>However, this is rather easy to get around if you happen to have a server based in the US with SSH access. What you need to do is set up a SSH tunnel to your US server, then instruct your web browser to connect via that tunnel. This will cause all connections to Hulu to go through your US server, and will make it possible to watch Hulu videos.</p>
<p><strong>Setting up using the SSH command/PuTTy</strong></p>
<p>SSH allows you to connect securely to the server and create a secure tunnel from your computer to the US-based server. You can set up a local SSH client program to do this.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-title">ssh</span> -D <span class="hljs-number">8080</span> -p <span class="hljs-number">22</span> -f -N username<span class="hljs-variable">@yourserver</span>.com</code></pre><p>As the SSH manual page states the -D option:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>-D port. Specifies <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">local</span> <span class="hljs-string">&quot;dynamic&quot;</span> application-level port forwarding.
 This works <span class="hljs-keyword">by</span> allocating <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">socket</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> listen <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> port <span class="hljs-command"><span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> <span class="hljs-title">the</span> <span class="hljs-title">local</span> <span class="hljs-title">side</span>, </span>
<span class="hljs-operator">and</span> whenever <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> connection is made <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> this port, <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> connection is
forwarded over <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> secure channel, <span class="hljs-operator">and</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> application protocol is <span class="hljs-keyword">then</span>

<span class="hljs-operator">the</span> SOCKS4 <span class="hljs-operator">and</span> SOCKS5 protocols are supported, <span class="hljs-operator">and</span> ssh will act <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> SOCKS server.</code></pre><p>You can also do this in Windows using the PuTTy SSH client. Look under Connection -&gt; SSH -&gt; Tunnels. Add a dynamic port forward, use port 8080 and no need to specify the destination.</p>
<p><strong>Setting Firefox to use the tunnel</strong></p>
<p>Then set up Firefox to use the local SOCKS server (localhost:8080). The relevant settings can be found under Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Network -&gt; Settings ... -&gt; Manual proxy configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>
<p>This works very nicely, because you are now connecting from an US IP. To verify this, open up Internet Explorer and check <a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org/">http://www.whatsmyip.org/</a> and do the same in Firefox. You should see two different IP addresses. Just remember that any videos you watch will be transferred twice (from a bandwidth usage perspective) - once to your US server and then back. A single video is only about a hundred megabytes or so, so this not particularly bad for the convinience though.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#3" title="2009-05-12 12:34:40">Mike</a>:</strong> Am I missing a step?</p>
<p>I have generated a public and private key via Cpanel on my US server. I have followed the instructions to the T as above. Don&#39;t I have tell Putty what my keys are?</p>
<p><strong><a href="#4" title="2009-05-12 12:56:15">admin</a>:</strong> That depends on whether you are using public key authentication or only password authentication (check sshd_config). I don&#39;t know about Cpanel, never used it, but I would first  try connecting to the server via Putty. If your ssh daemon is configured to use public key authentication, then you will not be able to connect without a key.</p>
<p>If that works, then the next step would be set up the tunnel. Also, I recommend restarting your Firefox after changing the proxy settings or use the FoxyProxy addon - sometimes I have had odd glitches in applying the proxy settings in Firefox which went away when I used the addon.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#5" title="2009-05-12 17:24:58">Mike</a>:</strong> Well, learned a lot about Putty and SSH in Cpanel today. So far I have Putty allowing me to login to my server using my private key via Jail Shell (host doesn&#39;t offer SSH).</p>
<p>Where I&#39;m lost is the instructions:</p>
<p>Putty: Connection -&gt; SSH -&gt; Tunnels. Add a dynamic port forward, use port 8080
Firefox: Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Network -&gt; Settings … -&gt; Manual proxy configuration</p>
<p>Instructions say to set the port to 8080. I tried that didn&#39;t work. The host has me using port 3765 so I tried that too.</p>
<p>Browser gives me error, and refuses to connect.</p>
<p>Is it Jail Shell messing with me here?</p>
<p><strong><a href="#6" title="2009-05-12 17:26:54">Mike</a>:</strong> Sorry, didn&#39;t see your update here until I refreshed...will try your suggestions with Firefox next.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#7" title="2009-05-12 19:13:40">admin</a>:</strong> When you try to access a site such as Google via your browser, if what you get is long wait then probably there is something wrong with the browser settings (try FoxyProxy). This means that the browser is accessing the tunnel but something is wrong.</p>
<p>If, however, you get a connection refused (or similar) error almost immediately, then check the SSH tunnel. You might have to wrong port, or restrictive firewall settings on your computer.</p>
<p>Also, since it seems you do not fully control your server (shared hosting?), there is the possibility that the AllowTcpForwarding setting is &quot;no&quot; for the ssh daemon, which means that tunneling is not allowed on the ssh daemon on the server - in which case you need to upgrade to something that allows you to configure your server fully.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#8" title="2009-05-14 08:50:55">Maccer</a>:</strong> I&#39;m sorry but I didn&#39;t get the Setting up Firefox to use the tunnel part. I don&#39;t know where to put localhost:8080. Please help me. I&#39;m desperate.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#10" title="2009-05-18 18:28:24">daniel</a>:</strong> Sorry to be a kill-joy, but I&#39;m pretty sure a SSH tunnel won&#39;t cut it, at least it doesn&#39;t for me. I assume that hulu uses UDP to provide the video thus making the SSH tunnel only viable for loading thumbnails and such, but not for the actual video streaming.
I get the &quot;unable to to stream this video &quot; error despite being connected by a SSH tunnel through a US box.
What we need is a way to tunnel (hulu specific) UDP traffic over the established SSH tunnel.
A real VPN would always be the preferred way of course, but since most of the cheap virtual server hosts don&#39;t offer the necessary interfaces to build a VPN, we&#39;re left with SSH tunneling as the only viable option.</p>
<p>Any ideas here?</p>
<p><strong><a href="#11" title="2009-05-19 07:29:03">admin</a>:</strong> Nope, still works. And Hulu does not seem to use UDP for watching videos, at least I am not seeing any additional packets coming in received while watching a video.</p>
<p>If you can see the site via your browser, and your browser IP is correct (US), then I can&#39;t think of other reasons than that Flash is not using the tunnel to connect - might be that Flash on Linux/Mac will not obey the proxy settings.</p>
<p>Of course it could also be that your server is blocked by Hulu or that different shows have different streaming mechanisms, although I doubt that either of these is the reason. I haven&#39;t tested this extensively, so mileage may vary.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#12" title="2009-05-24 17:28:22">Parneix</a>:</strong> I have the same problem as Daniel : though I&#39;m able to open a SSH tunnel giving me a US IP adress (and I know how to configure my network setting on a Mac to get both Safari and Forefox to use it) I still can&#39;t get anything from Hulu. I also tried this trick (see link), but still no success. Any idea? Thanks a lot for the article.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#13" title="2009-05-24 17:33:57">Parneix</a>:</strong> The info I get from Proxifier while trying to connect to Hulu is the following. Maybe it could help someone to understand what&#39;s going on (and wrong) :</p>
<p>Error : The proxy server localhost:8080 has unexpectedly terminated the connection
JavaApplicationS - Could not connect to 127.0.0.1:17747 through the proxy server</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>P.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#14" title="2009-05-24 20:31:10">admin</a>:</strong> I did a bit digging on this issue with OSX, and apparently Adobe Flash does not always obey the proxy settings set in the browser or the OS.</p>
<p>Have a look at this bug filed for Flash: <a href="http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-673">http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-673</a></p>
<p>As for Parneix, you are clearly on the right track. What exactly is shown on your browser when you access Hulu versus some other site like google or whatsmyip? Screenshots?</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t used OSX but I suspect the problem is with Flash not obeying the proxy settings, it seems the proxy server at localhost:8080 is trying to connect to localhost (127.0.0.1) to get data, which is incorrect.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#15" title="2009-05-28 20:18:11">Anonymous</a>:</strong> I&#39;m not convinced this actually works.</p>
<p>I&#39;m quite aware of SSH tunneling as a way to proxy a connection, I&#39;ve used this technique for years on many OS&#39;s. I&#39;m currently on a Vista machine and I&#39;m having no luck with Hulu. That&#39;s actually why I&#39;m still searching blogs for a working SSH tunnel solution.</p>
<p>I also assumed Flash was not respecting proxy settings, and it seems to be the case on my Windows machine. Are you sure you&#39;re not American and don&#39;t know it? :)</p>
<p><strong><a href="#16" title="2009-06-16 19:05:41">Anonymous</a>:</strong> Use either HTTP SSL proxy (i.e. HTTP proxy with CONNECT option) or SOCKS proxy (e.g. SSH tunnel) and proxify browser through it using ProxyCap <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=JA74JPR7">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=JA74JPR7</a> (ProxyCap works only on 32-bit Windows)</p>
<p>That&#39;s the only workaround for flash player bug.</p>
<p>Also you can use Transporter (which includes hack to remove ads...) + ProxyCap.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#17" title="2009-07-01 07:56:44">anon</a>:</strong> Does the hulu video go through the tunnel such that anyone sniffing your packets cannot tell you are watching a video? Like at work.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#18" title="2009-12-04 10:02:58">Shon</a>:</strong> Nope this wont work with Hulu anymore. Though it will work with some other sites such as Pandora or whatismyip.com</p>
<p>The reason it doesn&#39;t work with Hulu is mainly because Flash/RTMP does not respect the system / browsers proxy settings. The browser functions will work so Hulu won&#39;t flag you for being outside the US but when the browser tells flash to initiate the stream it fails with &quot;Sorry we are unable to stream this video&quot;. Adobe does not consider this a problem. This is the same issue as a general SOCKS proxy will have.</p>
<p>To access Hulu you need a VPN solution that actually tunnels the traffic at the network layer. OR you could use some specific software to catch those RTMP requests and redirect them to a proxy. Foxyproxy has a software solution (video helper) for windows I believe. Though I&#39;m on a mac so VPN it is.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#19" title="2010-02-28 02:47:57">Mike</a>:</strong> I was able to get this working using Proxifier and a SSH tunnel through our Yankee server. Proxifier will route all network traffic through the tunnel, this includes Adobe flash.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#20" title="2010-05-12 19:17:53">Mike</a>:</strong> Hulu is a no go.... I was able to connect to ABC.com, youtube.com (accessing restricted content) and fox.com</p>
<p><strong><a href="#21" title="2010-05-16 15:33:43">Tunneling</a>:</strong> You can use the software from <a href="http://www.interwap.ro">http://www.interwap.ro</a> . They have free access at 384kbps and low prices for up to 50mbps high speeds.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#22" title="2010-08-30 16:27:12">Jay</a>:</strong> UDP??   Do you understand what UDP is?   Or better, why this would not work for streaming a video?</p>
<p><strong><a href="#23" title="2010-10-28 08:44:51">Lala</a>:</strong> One key critical piece of missing information is that you need is block outgoing connections to a few of Hulu&#39;s servers on your local machine.</p>
<p>Flash attempts connections in the following manner:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try connecting directly to the server</li>
<li>If that failed, try connecting through the proxy server specified in IE.
If #1 succeeds, Flash would completely bypass your SSH tunnel and reveal your real IP to Hulu.</li>
</ol>
<p>So you need to figure out the servers that Hulu us trying to connect to, and block them. To figure out the servers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install &quot;Live HTTP Headers&quot; addon for Firefox and open it up</li>
<li>Go to the Hulu video you want to watch</li>
<li>In the Generator window, you will see a few urls that Hulu is hitting. The ones ending in /fcs/ident and /fcs/ident2 are interesting to us. They would be something like &quot;hulufs.fplive.net&quot; and &quot;hulu-123.fcod.llwnd.net&quot;</li>
<li>Figure out the IPs for these 2 servers... simply ping it or something. Do it for both your local connection and your SSH servers, so you would end up with 4 different IPs. The hosts are on a round-robin DNS so they will give up different IPs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now to block the IPs, in Vista/Win7, you can simply use the built-in firewall that comes as part of the OS. Any low level firewall which can be custom configured should work. For Vista/Win7:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start menu -&gt; type in &quot;Windows Firewall with Advanced Security&quot;.</li>
<li>Go to Outbound Rules in the left panel</li>
<li>Click on New Rule on the right panel</li>
<li>Select: Custom Rule, click Next</li>
<li>Select: All Programs, click Next</li>
<li>Select: Any for protocol type, click Next</li>
<li>For scope, add the 4 IPs you found to the REMOTE IP addresses list, click Next</li>
<li>Select Block the Connection, click Next</li>
<li>Select all profiles, click Next</li>
<li>Name it, and Finish</li>
</ol>
<p>And finally...</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the socks proxy server in IE to localhost:8080 or whatever you specified (only the socks proxy, not the rest) and enable it</li>
<li>Set the socks proxy server in whatever browser you&#39;re using (Firefox, Opera, etc). Chrome should use the IE setting.</li>
</ol>
<p>And after that long process, you should be able to view any Hulu video.</p>
<p>The IPs/Servers might change, so you might need to expand your IP block list from time to time.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#25" title="2011-04-01 23:56:04">d</a>:</strong> brilliant.</p>
<p>thank you!!!!!</p>
<p>done on my mac connecting to one of my servers in the states.</p>
<p>Didn&#39;t need to block any hulu IP&#39;s.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#26" title="2011-04-01 23:57:41">Mikito Takada</a>:</strong> Good to hear that this still works!</p>
