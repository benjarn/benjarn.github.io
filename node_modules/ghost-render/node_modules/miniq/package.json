  "readme": "# miniq\n\nminiq is yet another tiny async control flow library. It implements parallelLimit, with the ability to share the concurrency-limited queue.\n\n## Features\n\n- small: miniq only implements `parallelLimit`\n- can be used for all three basic control flow patterns\n  - `series` = `parallel(1, tasks, onDone)`\n  - `parallel` without a concurrency limit = `parallel(Infinity, tasks, onDone)`\n  - `parallel` with a concurrency = default behavior\n- no result passing: Many control flow libraries have a dozen variants which simply pass the result around in slightly different ways (e.g. `chain` vs. `map`). I'd rather just use JavaScript's scope rules to handle all those variants rather than have specialized functions for each thing.\n- Node 10.x compatibility\n\nminiq has one advanced feature, which is the ability to share the concurrency-limited queue among multiple different tasks. In other words, many different sets of operations can share the same queue and run limit. Each set of tasks can have it's own `onDone` function, but they share the same concurrency limit.\n\nFor example, if you are writing something that does a recursive directory traversal and does various (file system) operations, you can push all the operations into the same queue. This will allow you to limit (file system) concurrency across multiple operations.\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install --save miniq\n\n## API\n\n`parallel(limit, tasks, [onDone])`:\n\n- `limit` is a number which controls the maximum number of concurrent tasks. Set `limit = 1` for serial execution and `limit = Infinity` for unlimited parallelism.\n- `onDone` is a callback `function(err) { ... }`; it is called when the tasks it is associated with have run\n- `tasks` are callbacks `function(done) { ... }` which should call `done()` when they are complete.\n\nThe return value is an object with a function `.exec(tasks, onDone)`. Calling this function appends the new set of tasks and queues the `onDone` function once all of those tasks have completed.\n\n## Some notes on Node 0.10.x (supported since `0.1.x`)\n\n`miniq` uses `setImmediate` when available to break call stacks. The purpose of this is to prevent stack overflows from occurring when executing in a tight loop.\n\nHowever, note that this has a performance impact which can be substantial and is unnecessary if your payloads are already asynchronous - for example, with a test tree of 40k file read tasks using `file-dedupe` (which uses `miniq` internally), the runtime went from 50s to 30s simply by disabling the stack breaking.\n\nBecause of the potential performance impact, I've added the `.maxStack` property on the queue; this is set to `50` by default, which seems to retain a good balance between call stack size and avoiding scheduling overhead. To set the `maxStack`, set it on the return value. For example:\n\n    var queue = parallel(10, [ ... ], onDone);\n    queue.maxStack = Infinity;\n\n## Example: replacement for `parallelLimit`\n\n    var parallel = require('miniq');\n\n    parallel(10, [\n      function(done) {\n        fs.readFile(function(err, result) {\n          if(err) {\n            return done(err); // done takes one argument: the error\n          }\n        }\n      },\n    ], function(err) {\n      // err is sent if any of the tasks returned an error\n    });\n\n\n## Example: replacement for `parallel`\n\n    var parallel = require('miniq');\n\n    parallel(Infinity, [\n      function(done) { ... },\n    ], function(err) {\n      // err is sent if any of the tasks returned an error\n    });\n\n## Example: replacement for `series`\n\n    var parallel = require('miniq');\n\n    parallel(1, [\n      function(done) { ... },\n    ], function(err) {\n      // err is sent if any of the tasks returned an error\n    });\n\n## Example: using miniq as a shared maximum-concurrency limited queue\n\n    var parallel = require('miniq');\n\n    function Foo() {\n      this.queue = parallel(12);\n    }\n\n    Foo.prototype.bar = function() {\n      this.queue.exec(tasks, function(err) { ... });\n    };\n\n    Foo.prototype.all = function() {\n      // when the queue is empty\n      this.queue.once('empty', function() {\n        console.log('All done!');\n      });\n\n      this.queue.exec(tasks);\n    };\n",
